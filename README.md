## The Challenge

Challenges are divided into three tiers based on the knowledge and experience
required to complete them.

| Tier | DevOps Profile                                                                                                                                                |
| :--: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | DevOps in the early stages of their learning journey. Those who are typically experienced deploying user-facing applications such as nodejs apps, ruby web apps, and php laravel apps on virtual machines or in cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure or Heroku. Someone who can leverage ElasticBeanstalk. Also has deep knowledge on Linux Fundamentals and Databases that can leverage AWS RDS for MySQL and PostgreSQL and etc. Basic understanding on AWS basic services such as  VPC, Security Groups, S3, Route53, Cloudfront, Application Load Balancer, EC2 and IAM.                |
|  2   | DevOps at an intermediate stage of learning and experience. Deep understanding on Docker and Containerization. Can deploy containerize apps or api services on Amazon ECS. They are comfortable in automation tools such as Cloudformation or Terraform and Docker. Comfortable using development tools such as AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeCommit and CodeDeploy for CI/CD. Have experience automating applications using scripts and other third party libraries. |
|  3   | DevOps who have all of the above, and are learning more advanced techniques like implementing microservices applications using Kubernetes and can leverage AWS EKS                   |


## Requirements
**ðŸŒŸ What Youâ€™ll need to build ðŸŒŸ**

This repository includes a simple and very minimal express nodejs app in the root directory (**./express-minapp**). What you need to do is use this user-facing application and deploy it on AWS. AWS Account will be provided by apper.ph. The deployment and infrastructure varies differently on each tier. Please refer to the diagram and instructions on each tier.

**ðŸŒŸ What you are encouraged to use and our judging criteria ðŸŒŸ**

Automation and CI/CD are the heart of DevOps. So you're encourage to use development tools, CI/CD tools and automation tools accordingly at all times.
